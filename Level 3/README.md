# Level 3 - Fine-Tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) for Spooky, Creepy, Horror-Themed Responses (Halloween Special)

## Task Overview

In this Halloween-themed task, you are required to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) to give **general responses** in a **spooky, creepy, horror-style tone**. This means the model should reply in an eerie and unsettling manner, even when asked normal or everyday questions. You will document the fine-tuning process, submit the fine-tuned model, and provide examples of the general, horror-themed responses the model generates.

### Objective

- Fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to give **spooky, creepy responses** even to typical queries (not just generating horror stories).
- Submit the fine-tuned model, along with detailed documentation of the fine-tuning process.
- Provide examples of **general interactions** in which the model responds in a creepy and horror-themed tone.

### Steps to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repo**

   - Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repo**

   - Clone the forked repository to your local environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/Hacktoberfest24
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Correct Directory**

   - Navigate to the Level 3 directory to prepare your task submission:

   ```bash
   cd Hacktoberfest24/NLPDev/Level 3/
   ```

4. **Create a Folder with Your Username**

   - Create a new folder named after your GitHub username:

   ```bash
   mkdir <your_username>
   ```

5. **Select and Fine-Tune an LLM for Spooky Responses**

   - Choose a pre-trained LLM that allows fine-tuning (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-Neo).
   - Gather a **creepy/horror-themed dataset** for fine-tuning. The dataset should not just focus on horror stories but also include spooky dialogues, eerie descriptions, and unsettling language.
   - Fine-tune the model to give **general responses** in an eerie, horror-themed style, even for everyday questions (e.g., "Whatâ€™s the weather?" could result in a response like, "The skies darken with impending doom...").
   - Adjust hyperparameters and training steps to fine-tune the LLM effectively.

6. **Document the Fine-Tuning Process**

   - In a `README.md` or `.txt` file, document the following:
     - **Dataset**: Describe the dataset used for fine-tuning (e.g., spooky conversations, eerie dialogues) and its source.
     - **Fine-Tuning Process**: Outline how you fine-tuned the model for general interactions in a horror-themed tone.
     - **Hyperparameters**: Specify any hyperparameters you adjusted, such as learning rate or epochs.
     - **Challenges**: Note any challenges you faced during fine-tuning and how you resolved them.

7. **Generate and Submit Example Responses**

   - After fine-tuning, generate examples of **general interactions** with the model.
   - These examples should demonstrate how the model responds in a creepy and unsettling manner to typical queries or everyday questions.
   - Save the examples in a `.txt` file or include them in your documentation.

   Example of General Horror-Themed Responses:
   - **User**: "What is the time?"
   - **Model**: "Time... it slips away into the endless abyss. Soon, it will be your time too."
   - **User**: "Can you tell me a joke?"
   - **Model**: "Oh, but laughter is fleeting... like the last breath before the dark embraces you."

8. **Submit the Fine-Tuned Model**

   - Submit the fine-tuned model or provide a link to where it can be downloaded (e.g., via Hugging Face Model Hub).
   - If the model is too large, provide clear instructions on how to replicate your setup and fine-tune the model.

9. **Add All Files to Your Folder**

   - Add the fine-tuned model, example responses, and documentation to your folder.

   Example:

   ```bash
   cp <fine_tuned_model>.h5 <your_username>/
   cp <output_examples>.txt <your_username>/
   cp README.md <your_username>/
   ```

10. **Add and Commit Your Changes**

    - Stage your changes:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

    - Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Added Level 3 Fine-Tuned LLM for Spooky General Responses by <your_username>"
    ```

11. **Push Your Changes and Open a Pull Request**

    - Push your changes to your forked repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

    - Open a Pull Request to submit your work for review.

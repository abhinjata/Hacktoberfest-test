# NLPDev Task Contributions

This repository contains tasks related to developing Bots and NLP-based solutions at different levels of complexity. Each level presents a unique challenge ranging from designing AI prompts to developing Discord bots and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Follow the steps below to contribute your solutions.

## Task Levels Overview

### Level 0: Convincing AI of a False Fact

- **Objective**: Create a prompt that convinces an AI to believe and accept a completely false, interesting fact.
  
- **Process**:
  - Design an initial prompt that introduces the false fact.
  - Interact with the AI to see how it responds to the prompt.
  - Iteratively adjust the prompt to improve its effectiveness until the AI accepts the fact.
  - Document each iteration of the prompt, along with the AI's responses, and explain how the prompt was refined over time.

- **Submission**: 
  - Document the entire process (prompts, AI responses, and iterations) in a `.txt` or `.md` file.
  - Add the file to your folder in the `Level0` directory.

### Level 1: Run a Chat Interface with an LLM

- **Objective**: Run a simple chat interface using a Large Language Model (LLM).

- **Process**:
  - Install a run a simple chat interface to interact with an open-source LLM.
  - You can implement this either locally or by using a platform like Google Colab.
  - Test the interface by having a conversation with the LLM and ensure it supports basic communication.

- **Submission**: 
  - Provide screenshots of the chat interface and the conversation with the LLM.
  - If applicable, submit the `.ipynb` file for Google Colab or the relevant code files.
  - Include documentation on how to run the interface in your folder in the `Level 1` directory.

### Level 2: Developing a Discord Bot

- **Objective**: Build a Discord bot with at least one core functionality (moderation, entertainment, or utility).

- **Process**:
  - Develop the bot using any programming language or framework you prefer.
  - Implement one or more core features of the bot (e.g., moderation commands, a fun game, or a utility function like reminders).
  - Test the bot on a Discord server to ensure it works as expected.

- **Submission**:
  - Submit the bot’s source code along with any necessary configuration files.
  - Include screenshots that showcase the bot’s features in action.
  - If possible, provide a server invite link where the bot is live.
  - Add all the required files to your folder in the `Level2` directory.

### Level 3: Fine-Tuning a Large Language Model (LLM)

- **Objective**: Fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform a specific task, such as generating text in a specific style or solving a particular type of problem.

- **Process**:
  - Select a pre-trained LLM and fine-tune it for a specific task (e.g., generating text in a spooky style for Halloween).
  - Gather and preprocess the dataset for fine-tuning.
  - Train the model with the fine-tuned dataset and test its performance.
  - Document the fine-tuning process, including the dataset used, hyperparameters, and any issues encountered.

- **Submission**:
  - Submit the fine-tuned model.
  - Include examples of the outputs generated by the fine-tuned model.
  - Provide a detailed README documenting the fine-tuning process (dataset, method, parameters, etc.).
  - Add the model, outputs, and README to your folder in the `Level3` directory.

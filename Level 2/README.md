# Level 2 - Developing a Discord Bot

## Task Overview

In this task, you are required to develop a Discord bot with any functionality of your choice, such as moderation, entertainment, or utility. The bot should demonstrate at least one core feature. You will submit the bot’s source code, relevant images showcasing its functionality, and a server invite link if it is live on a Discord server.

### Objective

- Develop a Discord bot with one or more core functionalities.
- Test the bot on a Discord server to ensure its proper functionality.
- Submit the bot’s code and images showing it in action.
- Suggestion : Use Hikari/Lightbulb and discord.py

### Steps to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repo**

   - Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repo**

   - Clone the forked repository to your local environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/Hacktoberfest24
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Correct Directory**

   - Navigate to the Level 2 directory to prepare for submitting your task:

   ```bash
   cd Hacktoberfest24/NLPDev/Level 2/
   ```

4. **Create a Folder with Your Username**

   - Create a new folder named after your GitHub username:

   ```bash
   mkdir <your_username>
   ```

5. **Develop the Discord Bot**

   - Create a Discord bot using any programming language or framework (e.g., Python with `discord.py`).
   - Implement one or more core features, such as:
     - **Moderation**: Commands to kick, ban, or mute users.
     - **Entertainment**: Fun games, meme generation, trivia, etc.
     - **Utility**: Reminders, information retrieval, task automation.
   - Test the bot on your Discord server to ensure it works correctly.

6. **Capture Bot in Action**

   - Take screenshots that show the bot in action (e.g., performing a command, interacting with users).
   - If your bot is live, provide a server invite link where it can be tested.

7. **Document the Bot**

   - In a `.txt` or `.md` file, document:
     - **Bot Features**: Describe the bot’s core features.
     - **How to Run the Bot**: Instructions for setting up the bot locally, including dependencies and token setup.
     - **Libraries/Tools Used**: List the frameworks, libraries, or tools you used (e.g., `discord.py`).

8. **Submit the Code and Documentation**

   - Add the bot’s code, along with any dependencies or configuration files.
   - Include the documentation (`README.md` or `.txt` file) and screenshots of the bot in action.

   Example:

   ```bash
   cp <your_bot_code>.py <your_username>/
   cp README.md <your_username>/
   cp <your_screenshots>.png <your_username>/
   ```

9. **Add and Commit Your Changes**

   - Stage your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   - Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added Level 2 Discord Bot task by <your_username>"
   ```

10. **Push Your Changes and Open a Pull Request**

    - Push your changes to your forked repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

    - Open a Pull Request to submit your work for review.
